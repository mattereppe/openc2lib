"""OpenC2 library

openc2lib provides an opensource implementation of the OpenC2 language and support for 
integration of encoding formats and protocol syntax.

All language elements are named according to the standard, with minor variations to
account for reserved keywords and characters.

All the target and data types defined by the standard are available for creating OpenC2 
commands.

The following base structures are also available for extending the language (see Sec. 3.1.1 of 
the Language Specification):
- `Enumerated`
- `EnumeratedID`
- `Array`
- `ArrayOf`
- `Map`
- `MapOf`
