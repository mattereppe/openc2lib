# Run the test suites

There are multiple tests available to check the compliance of openc2lib with the Language Specification, concerning data types, serialization, and message exchange.

## Data types
A first set of tests concerns the correct instantiation of data, including both data, targets, args, artifacts, and commands.
To run these tests, enter the ```types``` folder and run:
```
# pytest
```
