Background
==========

Before using openc2lib you must be familiar with the `OpenC2 Language Specification <https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2ls/v1.0/cs02/oc2ls-v1.0-cs02.pdf>`__.

Even if not strictly required to getting started with the code, the
`OpenC2 Architecture Specification <https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2arch/v1.0/cs01/oc2arch-v1.0-cs01.pdf>`__ provides a good introduction to OpenC2 architectural patterns and terminology. 

Other relevant documentation is listed in the `Related documents <docs/relateddocuments.md>`__ Section.
